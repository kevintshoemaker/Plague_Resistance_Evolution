As data, there will be a host of genes that are identified as potentially related to resistance (candidate loci). \n# some of these genes may be apparently related to resistance in the field (rangewide screeing) and lab (challenge experiments... )\n# some of these genes may be apparently related to resistance in the field on the basis of the SPV trials\n\n\n\n### To model this is tricky. We are not talking about just one gene probably. We are talking about a messier situation\n###    Some of these resistance alleles may be dominant, others recessive. That is, the heterozygote may in some cases be killed by plague just like susceptibles.\n###       in other cases, the heterozygote may survive plague similar to a homozygote \"resistant\"\n###       in other cases, the heterozygote may be resistant, while both homozygotes may be susceptible (overdominance)\n###       in other cases, the heterozygote may be killed, while the homozygotes may survive (underdominance)\n###       in other cases, there may be multiple alleles at certain key loci at a population level, each of which has different effect sizes and dominance.\n###       in other cases, genes may act in concert to confer resistance (epistasis)\n###     ***dominance of resistance can have an important role to play in influencing the rate of resistance evolution\n\n###  Needless to say, this is complex! To address this issue, we assume that \n# there is a maximum resistance level (biological limit to plague survival given the current gene pool) (assume no mutation)\n# The mixture of dominance and epistasis and linkage means that the degree to which resistance factors are passed from generation to generation are limited... \n# There will be much uncertainty as to epistasis and dominance. \n# no indiv will have all resistance factors- so gene interactions and such will be uncertain. We won't have this information\n# also, the results from the lab challenges may differ substantially from the results from the field screening. The genes that appear to evolve in the\n#   screening may differ from the genes that appear to affect survival in lab challenges.\n# This difference (i.e., between lab and field) could be very telling and an interesting thing to make hypotheses about...\n# keep track of abundance for all possible genotypes? BUT this gets very computationally intensive for large numbers of genes.\n# compute survival for all possible genotype? we won't have this information.\n\n\n##  NEW STRATEGY:\n# for each cell keep track of the current survival rate in the hypothetical case of plague and the current survival rate in the hypothetical case of no plague.  \n\n \n\n## new strategy will better accommodate the data we have. We have multi-locus allele frequencies before and after plague, and we have\n# the degree to which the resulting gene pool might improve survival. We possibly have survival over several plague outbreaks (see if the\n# survival rate increases with each plague outbreak?). We have information on colony collapse for many years, which may help to indicate\n# how fast resistance is evolving in this system...\n\n\n## HYPOTHESES\n\n# Endemic plague can play a strong role in maintaining resistance during periods of no plague.   [dynamics in endemic vs naive?]\n# Intermittent selection coupled with fitness costs can explain the plague equilibrium in the Asian case\n# Effective evolution of resistance depends on large-scale outbreaks- beyond what is possible if pdogs were the primary vector.\n# Is the asian system evidence of fitness costs- is there any other way to make that happen?\n\n## QUESTIONS\n\n# Is it possible that we could look at other factors influencing disease severity, like other diseases\n# can we evaluate the breakdown of social units under plague and how that contributes to disease spread and the evolution of resistance?\n\n# can we model alternative hosts? Pool all rodents together?? \n# what about alternative dispersers of infected flea vectors? What does that do?\n\n# how does the degree of resistance in the alternative hosts influence the rate of evolution?\n\n# should we include a flea population also? Three populations: flea, rodent, and focal host? \n\n# either resistance can increase flea load and host competence or decrease flea load and host competence.. \n\n# for plague to spread, hosts need to transmit to fleas, which transmit to other \n\n# focus on novel vector-borne disease?\n\n# do we need an IBM to complement this landscape model? - influence of resistance on transmission rate?\n # - influence of pdog social behavior on transmission rate? Breakdown of sociality?\n # - clipping? grooming?\n\n\n# we need to keep track of individual genes because that's the data we will have. (how to link this data with this model?)\n\n# should we account for the percentage of dispersers that establish and mate in the recipient population??\n\n# should plague resistance potential decrease over time??  Simulating the loss of evolutionary potential under strong selection?\n\n# effect of temporal/spatial variance in selection pressures / potential for resistance / fitness costs ??\n\n# what is the role of Allee effects?\n\n\n# can we verify the model of colonization and colony expansion using the rangewide data synthesis?  Probably, right??\n\n##### NOTES\n\n# might include strong allee effect. At low densities, more susceptible to predators etc. At high densities, populations actually do better, until they reach the threshold.. \n\n# should resistance acquisition be proportional to the strength of the selection force?\n\n\n\n#### New idea!   a prevalence map for each resistance factor. Those maps get smoothed during dispersal and amplified during survival/selection\n  # these factors can influence survival to plague as an addidive or non-additive relationship... \n\n\n# we can make hypotheses about the additivity, about the spatial distribution of the factors and prevalence etc.  \n# can some factors be lost to the population if they are very low frequency?\n\n# this could be testable, or more testable that is... \n\n\n\n###### from discussion on 8/5/16\n\n# resistance to plague reduces the transmission of plague. How does that affect this model?\n# is there some threshold by which transmission among colonies is notably diluted? At what level do you need resistance before it affects transmission??\n# what are the effects of the reduction of transmission with resistance on the evolution of resistance itself?\n\n# no such thing as chronic disease in the plague world. \n# should include a plague reservoir (other rodent species, pooled)\n#   every once in a while plague jumps through the reservoir\n#   look at avialable literature on plague in other rodents- and the env drivers especially\n# pdogs serve as plague amplifiers but not the primary reservoir\n#    given that, how do pdogs really affect the plague cycle?\n#    can we look at potential resistance within the reservoir (and the type of resistance?)\n#    \n# stay away from enzootic vs epizootic (but I'm not so sure this isn't interesting)\n\n# what level of resistance is necessary to allow for large pdog complex?\n\n# [my thought] what about evolution of social behaviors? lower densities? Decreased tendency to form large contiguous colonies?\n\n# this is a good model system because pdogs were truly naive to plague, and near 100% susceptible\n\n# can we think about getting genome scan for reservoir species?\n\n# two phases of transmission- among individuals and among colonies. we focus on the second\n\n## Notes from Katie...\n\n# resistance as a mixed trait- encourages endemicity? Some of the population is always susceptible and capable of transmitting the disease. \n# some of the population is resistant and incapable of transmitting the disease. Why encourage endemicity? Because some susceptible individuals are\n# always present\n\n# It will be difficult to incorporate the change in transmission with resistance because we don't have the data\n\n# It should be fine to think about transmission as the probability of getting plague (especially as a function of pop density, size and number of \n    # surrounding infected populations)\n\n# Tonie really wants to focus on coevolution, and has historical plague samples\n\n# I think the stability of plague makes this a good model system for studying the host evolution- isolating that as the main evolutionary process\n\n# Plague is a good model system because it is an inherently virulent disease. Novel emerging diseases are likely to exhibit extreme virulence and \n#  influence host evolution in a similar way\n\n# Focus on novel vector-borne diseases. Vector-borne diseases are likely to become ever more prevalent and new diseases are likely to keep emerging\n# in a changing world.    (focus on climate change)\n\n# Plague is a good model system because we have data for a range of sites in which hosts are naive and have had many generations with which to evolve. \n\n\n# still, it seems that including data on the asian system would be very instructive... \n\n\n# Our modeling framework integrates simulation and statistical modeling. An appropriate way to model this system\n\n# hot epidemic with spatial \"popping\"- this is typical of a virulent disease- and the resulting intermittent selection pressures could \n#   have a huge impact on host resistance evolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
